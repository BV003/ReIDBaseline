               PKUSketchRE-ID Dataset Description
==================================================================
The dataset contains 200 persons, each of which has one sketch and two photos.

Photos of each person were captured during daytime by two cross-view cameras. 
We cropped the raw images (or video frames) manually to make sure that every 
photo contains the one specific person.

We have a total of 5 artists to draw all personsâ€™ sketches and 
every artist has his own painting style.

   In file 'a_46.txt', 'a' is the type of painting style and '46' denotes the number of sketches that belong to 'a' style.
   
   Note: We correct wrong statistics on the number of 'a' style and 'c' style in our paper.
